# CSG_Blockout

**CSG_Blockout** is a high-performance, modernized 3D level blockout and rapid prototyping plugin designed specifically for Godot 4.7.

Building upon the core concepts of [CSG Toolkit](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/3057), this plugin undergoes a complete code rewrite and architectural redesign. It features a Spatial Hash Grid algorithm for O(1) collision avoidance, a responsive 3D Pie Menu, modular array pattern repeaters and volume spreaders, and a defensive GDScript 2.0 static typing architecture to deliver a rock-solid, crash-free workflow for level designers.

## Architectural & Technical Highlights

### 1. Spatial Hash Grid Algorithm
In scatter placement calculations (`CSGSpreader3D`), traditional nested double-loop distance checks incur O(N^2) time complexity, leading to severe editor stuttering when instantiating large numbers of nodes.
`CSG_Blockout` introduces a **3D Spatial Hash Grid algorithm**:
- Divides 3D space into uniform cubic grid cells based on the minimum safe distance `min_distance` (Cell Size = `min_distance / sqrt(3)`).
- When attempting to place a new node, it only queries and compares existing positions within the candidate's cell and its 27 neighboring cells.
- Reduces collision detection complexity to **O(1)**, enabling instantaneous calculations even in complex blockouts containing hundreds of combined CSG primitives.

### 2. Interactive 3D Pie Menu
- **Shortcut Activated:** Press `Shift + A` inside the 3D editor viewport to trigger a radial vector Pie Menu directly at your mouse cursor.
- **Hierarchical Navigation:** The outer menu branches into Union, Intersection, and Subtraction CSG operations. Selecting an operation opens a shape submenu containing `CSGBox3D`, `CSGCylinder3D`, `CSGMesh3D`, `CSGPolygon3D`, `CSGSphere3D`, and `CSGTorus3D`.
- **Context Awareness:** If a `CSGShape3D` node is currently selected, selecting an operation updates the node's `operation` property via UndoRedo. If no node is selected, choosing a primitive creates and configures a new CSG shape node.
- **Deadzone & Gesture Controls:** Features a central deadzone. Clicking inside the deadzone or pressing right-click navigates back to the parent menu level or closes the Pie Menu.

### 3. Modular Pattern Repeaters & Volume Spreaders
- **`CSGRepeater3D`:** Extends `CSGCombiner3D`. Utilizes a Strategy pattern via custom `CSGPattern` resources (`CSGGridPattern`, `CSGCircularPattern`, `CSGSpiralPattern`, and `CSGNoisePattern`).
- **`CSGSpreader3D`:** Extends `CSGCombiner3D`. Supports scattering template instances within any 3D collision shape (`BoxShape3D`, `SphereShape3D`, `CapsuleShape3D`, `CylinderShape3D`, `HeightMapShape3D`, `ConcavePolygonShape3D`, `ConvexPolygonShape3D`) with overlap avoidance.

### 4. Procedural World-Aligned Grid & Material Presets
- **Triplanar Grid Shader:** Procedural world-aligned grid material with anti-aliased sub-pixel lines and checkerboard style. Remains perfectly aligned without texture stretching as objects move, rotate, or scale.
- **Built-in Presets:** Includes Light Grid, Dark Grid, Orange Accent Grid, Unshaded (None), and Custom Material slots.
- **Batch Application:** Quickly assign the active material preset to any selected `CSGShape3D` nodes in batch with full Undo/Redo integration.

### 5. GDScript 2.0 Static Typing & Defensive Design
- Strict static typing and `ClassDB` runtime validation across all codebase scripts.
- Integrated with `EditorUndoRedoManager` for complete `Ctrl + Z` / `Ctrl + Y` support on node creations, property modifications, and hierarchy shifts.
- Complete decoupling of editor-only logic from runtime builds, preventing orphan node leaks and scene data corruption.

### 6. Built-in Dual Language Localization (i18n)
- Powered by `CsgBlockoutI18n`. Supports seamless switching between English (`en`) and Simplified Chinese (`zh_CN`).
